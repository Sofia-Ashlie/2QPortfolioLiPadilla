    <h1> About Sumeru: </h1>
        <p>     The nation of Sumeru is known for housing the Sumeru Akademiya, 
            Sumeru’s main governing body and Teyvat’s largest and most prestigious academic center.  
            It is located in Sumeru City, also known as the “City of Wisdom”.  Sumeru’s culture is mainly centered on studying and research.
            Aside from this, Sumeru's landscape mainly consists of deserts and rainforests.  
            The nation worships Lesser Lord Kusanali, the Dendro Archon and God of Wisdom.  
            She is also referred to as “Buer” or “Nahida”.  Lesser Lord Kusanali became the successor of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata, 
            the previous Dendro Archon and God of Wisdom, after she perished in the Cataclysm 500 years ago.  
            The former God of Wisdom passed away after trying to remove the forbidden knowledge from the Irminsul, 
            the tree that held all information and memories of Teyvat.  Before she died, she took the purest branch from Irminsul to create her successor, Lesser Lord Kusanali.  
            After all memories of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata were erased from Teyvat, Lesser Lord Kusanali is believed by all,
            including herself, to have always been the original Dendro Archon.

    <h1> Sumeru's Lore: </h1>
        <p> In the beginning, Nabu Malikata, King Deshret, and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata were known as the three God-Kings of Sumeru who once built a city together.  
            However, Nabu Malikata eventually passed away.  Then, the city that the God-Kings built together was engulfed by a sandstorm, leading to its abandonment.  
            After Nabu Malikata’s death, King Deshret and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata parted ways and created their own civilizations.  
            Deshret rules over the Great Red Sand, while Greater Lord Rukkhadevata creates the Varuna Contraption that turns parts of the desert into a rainforest, which further flourishes with the help of her followers.  
            Sumeru City was then established on what is known as the Divine Tree.
            <br><br>
            King Deshret eventually succumbs to the "poison" of forbidden knowledge.  The forbidden knowledge brought calamities upon Sumeru and its people.
            Rukkhadevata then tried to save King Deshret's people by creating the Akasha system, which united people's wisdom.
            <br><br>
            The people of Sumeru, mainly the adults, take pride in being unable to have dreams, due to their core values of wisdom and rationality.  
            Only children had dreams.  Knowledge in Sumeru was managed through the Akasha system, where people used Akasha terminals to access information.  
            Only adults owned Akasha terminals.  The Akasha system was powered by the Gnosis of Greater Lord Rukkhadevata.  
            After the termination of the Akasha System, the people of Sumeru were able to dream once more.
